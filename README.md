# WIP: React Filter Library

A type-safe React library for building advanced filtering systems and query builders. Built with TypeScript, observable state management via `@legendapp/state`, and a flexible component architecture.

## What is this?

This library provides the core logic and state management for building sophisticated filtering interfaces like:

- Advanced search forms with nested conditions
- Query builders for databases or APIs
- Complex data filtering dashboards
- Multi-criteria selection interfaces
